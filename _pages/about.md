Additionally, I have developed programming expertise in Python and R, particularly in web scraping and econometric modeling. my academic journey, I have engaged in diverse research areas, specializing in microeconomics and econometrics. Notably, in my most recent project I applied innovative econometric volatility models to analyze gas reseller station prices, revealing valuable insights into the behavior of fuel prices in Brazil.
