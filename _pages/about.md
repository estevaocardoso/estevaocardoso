Hello, my name is Estev√£o Cardoso.

I am a MSc student in Economics with a strong background in quantitative methods, including statistics, mathematics, and econometric modeling. Additionally, I have developed programming expertise in Python and R, particularly in web scraping and econometric modeling. my academic journey, I have engaged in diverse research areas, specializing in microeconomics and econometrics. Notably, in my most recent project I applied innovative econometric volatility models to analyze gas reseller station prices, revealing valuable insights into the behavior of fuel prices in Brazil. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Economics at the Federal University of Pernambuco (PIMES/UFPE), where I have dedicated myself to improving my knowledge in econometrics and macroeconomics throughout the construction of my dissertation.
